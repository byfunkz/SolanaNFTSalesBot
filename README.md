Click on the "New Application" Button -> Name your Bot -> Create a Bot User by navigating to the ‚ÄúBot‚Äù tab and clicking ‚ÄúAdd Bot‚Äù -> Scroll down and make sure the bot has the following permission:
Give him the permission "Administrator". If you are afraid to bring him this approach, you can only mark the following approaches:

Invite the bot by navigating to the ‚ÄúOAuth2‚Äù tab -> Tick the ‚Äúbot‚Äù checkbox under ‚Äúscopes‚Äù. -> Check the permissions required for your bot to run under "Bot Permissions" -> Now the resulting URL can be used to add your bot to a server.
